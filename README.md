# [SampleCloud](http://samplecloud.ouspg.org/)

SampleCloud experiments with the ways to provide people who fuzz
with good quality sample sets, also known as corpus. We also try to find a way to make
contributing back to the pool possible.

## Samples

At the first stages of the project we will be gathering a static list of good sample sets already provided by third parties. If you are aware of any good existing sets not yet included in the list, please create an issue and include links to the project pages at our [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/ouspg/SampleCloud/issues) and we will add them to the list. You can find the current sample list [here](http://samplecloud.ouspg.org/samples.html).
