# SampleCloud

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/WhiteEyeDoll/SampleCloud.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/WhiteEyeDoll/SampleCloud)

SampleCloud experiments with the ways to provide people who fuzz
with good quality sample sets, also known as corpus. We also try to find a way to make
contributing back to the pool possible.

## Details

The project uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and
consists of separated backend and frontend applications.

## Documentation

Documentation is included in the [docs/](docks/) directory and is autobuilt/hosted
by using [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/) and [Read the Docs](https://readthedocs.org/) at [here](http://samplecloud.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
