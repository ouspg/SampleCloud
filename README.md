# SampleCloud

SampleCloud experiments with the ways to provide people who fuzz
with good quality sample sets, also known as corpus. We also try to find a way to make
contributing back to the pool possible.

## Details

The project uses [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) and [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/) and
consists of separated backend and frontend applications.
